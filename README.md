# Hackerthon#Tourist (Clone Blablacar)

This project is part of the **#LCNLP** hackathon. In this project we try to create a Blablacar clone. This main goal of this project is not to create the exact replique of the **Blablacar** webapp, but instead use it a case study to understand the workflow of the developpement of a software product as a team, And also learn Backend (Spring ecosystem ) and Frondtend (React Js, with Nextjs) technology
